the problem was that the default c (with no argv) code was creating a pointer to the executable file..
And executable code is read only code. So either create the 'a' in the stack frame or in the heap memory

char a[] = "this is me"     //stack frame

char *a = new malloc(100);      // heap memory
strcpy(a, "this is me");
free(a);
